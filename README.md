# infovis-secondo-progetto

Repository per il secondo progetto del corso di Visualizzazione delle Informazioni (Laurea Magistrale Ing. Informatica Roma Tre A.A.22/23)

This tool made in d3.js allows you to visualize calories and nutrient composition (water, protein, fat and carbohydrates) of foods inside the Foundation Foods dataset (updated on April 2023) made by U.S. Department of Agriculture.

A spreadsheet view is already available on their website (https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/325871/nutrients) but it's not so useful as it is needed to search for each indivudal food and is not useful for comparisons.
